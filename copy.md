STOP Wasting Months Fighting n8n's "Beginner Hell"
Master High-Value Automation Skills in 30 Days

 The Frustration of Automation
Here's a story that'll make you angry...
I'm not new to n8n. I've built dozens of workflows, some simple, some ridiculously complex.
But last night, one of them broke.
Not a big bug. Not some deep logic error. Just a stupid edge case that ate 4 hours of my time.
And for a second, I genuinely thought about walking away. Shutting it down. Saying "screw this" and going back to something easier.
Here's what no one tells you about automation:
It's not hard to start. It's hard to finish. Hard to fix. Hard to scale.
And if you're new to n8n, you're probably drowning in that exact frustration right now.

 The Brutal Truth About Learning n8n Solo
Over the past couple of weeks, dozens of people have reached out saying the same thing:
"How do I actually get started with n8n?" "I've been messing with it for months, but the learning curve is brutal." "I
keep starting workflows but never finishing them." "I feel like I'm missing something fundamental." They're right. n8n's powerful, but when you're starting out, it's a time-sucking nightmare.
   Time Wasted on Basics
Weeks just figuring out basic node connections
Fragile Workflows
Months building workflows that break the moment
real data hits them
Debugging Nightmares
Hours debugging simple errors that should take
minutes
Self-Doubt
Countless nights wondering if you're even cut out
for this
  Meanwhile, people who "get it" are building automations that save 20+ hours per week, landing $2K-5K clients, and scaling their agencies while you're still stuck on tutorial #47.
The gap between knowing the basics and actually building something profitable? It's massive.

 Why I'm Opening Up 5 Mentorship Spots
When I dropped what I called "the last n8n guide you'll ever need" on X, it exploded. But here's what happened next...
My DMs got flooded. Not with "thanks for the guide" messages.
With "Can you just help me build this?" requests.
People were tired of guides. Tired of tutorials. Tired of figuring it out alone.
They wanted someone to sit with them, point out what they were missing, and help them actually finish something that worked.
That's why I'm opening up 5 spots for direct n8n mentorship.

 BONUS: Get My Complete AI SDR Workflow
BONUS: Get My Complete AI SDR Workflow ($5,000 Value)
I'm also throwing in my complete AI SDR automation system - the exact workflow that generated $600K in sales for
one of my clients in just 90 days. This system automatically:
Finds qualified prospects Crafts personalized outreach Books sales appointments Manages follow-up sequences
Value: $5,000 Yours free when you join.
Plus access to my private collection of battle-tested workflows that I use in real client projects.

 This Isn't For Everyone Don't apply if:
You're looking for a magic bullet (this requires actual work)
You expect me to build everything for you (I'll guide, but you'll do the building)
You're not serious about making money with automation
This IS perfect if:
You're tired of tutorial hell and ready to build something real
You want to shortcut months of trial-and-error
You're serious about mastering automation as a high-value skill
You learn better with direct guidance than solo grinding
       
 Here's What This Could Cost You NOT to Take Action
   Scenario 1: You keep learning solo
6 more months of frustration =
180 hours wasted
Missing out on mastering a high-value skill = Priceless
Opportunity cost of not automating your business = Countless hours
Scenario 2: You hire someone to build what you need
My workflow building rate =
$5K+ per build
You learn nothing = Zero skill development
Scenario 3: You join a bootcamp or course
Quality automation training =
$2K-5K
Still no direct feedback = Months more struggle

 Investment: $200/week or $750/month
Rolling 30-day commitment - cancel anytime
Look, I could easily charge $2K+ for this kind of direct mentorship.
My workflow building rate starts at $5K per project, and you're getting that expertise applied to your learning.
But I want to make this accessible for people who are serious about mastering automation skills.

 Only 5 Spots Available (Here's Why)
I'm limiting this to 5 people because:
  Quality over quantity
I want to give each person real attention
My bandwidth
I still have my own business to run
Results matter
I'd rather help 5 people succeed than 50 people struggle
 
 FAQ
 Do I need any n8n experience?
Basic familiarity helps, but I've helped complete beginners. If you can follow instructions and put in effort, you'll do fine.
 What if I can't keep up?
We go at your pace. The goal is understanding, not speed.
 Is this live sessions or async?
Mix of both. Scheduled calls plus ongoing Slack/email support.
 What if my workflow idea is too complex?
We'll scope it properly or build it in phases. No project is too big if we break it down right.

 Make Your Choice
The choice is yours:
Keep struggling alone for the next 6 months...
Or let me shortcut your path to automation mastery in the next 30 days.
